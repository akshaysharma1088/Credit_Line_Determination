## 🔍 Overview

Traditional credit line increase (CLI) strategies rely on static scorecards that are blind to short-term behavioral signals. This project formalizes CLI as a **constrained profit maximization problem** under portfolio expected loss and fairness constraints, implemented via a calibrated XGBoost classifier with integrated TreeSHAP explainability — deployed within a governance architecture aligned with SR 11-7 and Basel IRB requirements.

### Key Results (500,000-account synthetic portfolio)

| KS Statistic | 0.312 | **0.443** |
| Brier Score | 0.044 | **0.031** |
| Expected Calibration Error | 0.019 | **0.011** |
| Expected Loss Reduction | — | **−18.3%** |
| Revenue Lift | — | **+11.2%** |
| Net Profit Improvement | — | **+14.7%** |

## 📊 Dataset: Synthetic Portfolio Design

The evaluation dataset is fully synthetic, generated using a Gaussian copula over credit bureau signals and behavioral features, with conditional default rates calibrated to published revolving credit portfolio benchmarks (Thomas et al., 2017; Siddiqi, 2006). **No real customer data is used or included.**

| Parameter | Specification |
|-----------|--------------|
| Accounts (N) | 500,000 |
| Observation horizon | 48 months (Years 1–4) |
| Label horizon (T) | 12 months forward-looking |
| Default definition | 60+ days past due or charge-off |
| Default rate (class imbalance) | 4.8% |
| Engineered features | 47 across 4 behavioral families |
| Train / Validation / Test | Years 1–2 / Year 3 / Year 4 (time-aware) |
| Generation method | Gaussian copula with calibrated marginals |

Generate the synthetic dataset:

```bash
python src/data/synthetic_generator.py \
  --n_accounts 500000 \
  --horizon_months 48 \
  --default_rate 0.048 \
  --output_path artifacts/synthetic_portfolio.parquet \
  --seed 42
```

## 🔧 Feature Engineering: Four Behavioral Families

All features are computed on **event-time windows** (not ingestion timestamps) to prevent training-serving skew. Windows are computed at t−3m, t−6m, and t−12m relative to the decision point.

### 1. Utilization Dynamics
| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `util_mean_3m` | Rolling mean utilization — 3-month window |
| `util_mean_6m` | Rolling mean utilization — 6-month window |
| `util_slope_6m` | Utilization trend slope (OLS over 6 months) |
| `util_volatility` | Standard deviation of monthly utilization |

### 2. Payment Stability
| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `payment_to_balance_ratio` | PTR = Payment / Statement Balance |
| `consecutive_ontime_payments` | Count of consecutive on-time payments |
| `full_to_min_payment_ratio` | Full payments / Minimum-only payments |
| `payment_timing_deviation_days` | Days deviation from payment due date |

### 3. Behavioral Stability
| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `spend_cv` | Coefficient of variation of monthly spend |
| `revolver_consistency` | Stability of revolving behavior indicator |
| `spend_entropy` | Shannon entropy over MCC spend distribution |

### 4. Risk Drift Indicators
| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `score_delta_3m` | Credit score change over 3 months |
| `score_delta_6m` | Credit score change over 6 months |
| `inquiry_count_90d` | Bureau inquiries in past 90 days |
| `delinquency_spike_flag` | Short-term delinquency spike indicator |

## ⚙️ Algorithm 1: Risk-Constrained Threshold Calibration

The core decisioning algorithm selects the optimal PD threshold that simultaneously maximizes portfolio profit while satisfying expected loss and fairness constraints.

```
Algorithm 1: Risk-Constrained Threshold Calibration

Input:  {PD_i, LGD_i, EAD_i, Δ_i} for i=1..N,  EL_target,  fairness tolerance ε
Output: Optimal decision threshold τ*

1. Sort accounts ascending by PD_i.
2. Initialize best_profit ← -inf,  τ* ← null
3. For each candidate τ in {sorted PD values}:
   a.  S(τ) ← { i : PD_i < τ }
   b.  EL(τ) ← Σ_{i∈S(τ)} PD_i · LGD_i · (EAD_i + Δ_i)
   c.  EOD(τ) ← |P(Approve|Y=1,A=0) − P(Approve|Y=1,A=1)|
   d.  If EL(τ) ≤ EL_target AND EOD(τ) ≤ ε:
          Profit(τ) ← Σ_{i∈S(τ)} Π_i
          If Profit(τ) > best_profit:
             best_profit ← Profit(τ);  τ* ← τ
4. Return τ*

Complexity: O(N log N) from initial sort; O(N) for cumulative EL scan.
```

Run threshold calibration:

```bash
python src/optimization/threshold_calibration.py \
  --scores_path artifacts/val_scores.parquet \
  --el_target 16000000 \
  --fairness_tolerance 0.05 \
  --lgd 0.70 \
  --net_margin 0.025
```

## 📐 Formal Problem Formulation

CLI is formalized as a constrained profit maximization problem. For account *i* with feature vector **X**_i ∈ ℝᵈ and proposed CLI Δ_i:

**Incremental revenue:**
```
R_i = γ · Δ_i · U_i
```

**Incremental expected loss:**
```
L_i = PD_i · LGD_i · (EAD_i + Δ_i)
```

**Optimization objective:**
```
max_w  Σ_{i∈S} Π_i     s.t.:   EL ≤ EL_target,   EOD ≤ ε,   0 ≤ Δ_i ≤ Δ_i^max
```

Where: γ = 0.025 (net margin rate), LGD = 0.70, mean Δ_i = $2,000, mean U_i = 0.35.
